      <p>To bring together local communities of amateur birdwatchers through social media and blog-style posting.</p>  <!-- change this -->


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>Amateur birdwatchers in local communities. Probably older (50-70) audiences will utilize the sight the most, but the website should not be age exclusive. That being said, the plan is to keep it simple to read and understand (big text, simple layout). </p>  <!-- change this -->
